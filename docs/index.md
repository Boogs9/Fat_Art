This project explores the representation of fatness in the MET API.

Here are some graphs about the distribution of fat artwork in the MET's digital collection.

The table below shows the most frequent mediums used for each century. Note that the number of artworks in each century varies drastically, from one to 42.

## Observations the photos 

The initial works found in art before the common era (BCE) use fatness as a descriptor for people and animals. Such as the photos found below.

From my observations the MET most as artwork about fatness from the 18th to the 19th century. These works use fatness as a character flaw to describe wealthy elites or nations that are hoarding.

*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
